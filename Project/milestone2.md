###    That you can handle the data in its size.
The dataset is large (2.5TB). We need a subset of the dataset. You can find the method we used to get the data in `get_data.md` file.

We concentrate our research on armed conflits where Afghanistan, Iraq, Mexico, Pakistan and Syria are involved during the years 2003-2013. The size of the clean data is less than 1MB.   

### That you understand what’s into the data (formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, etc.).
###    That you considered ways to enrich, filter, transform the data according to your needs.
###   That you have updated your plan in a reasonable way, reflecting your improved knowledge after data acquaintance. In particular, discuss how your data suits your project needs and discuss the methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.
###  That your plan for analysis and communication is now reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices that you considered but dropped.
